But I am not one of those guys whom you learn from. I am the guy that tries the hardest.
I dont know most of the things listed out here. This a superset of a project at work that
I could not do according to my will. Hence a lot of tech debt. But as you might already know
`A Lannister always pays his debts`.
So I decided to start this project. The best place to start is at the beginning so 
I will start with learning `Angular 5` and `Golang` both of which I have never worked on.
But fear not, I will start by writing down whatever I learn.
Looking forward to posting the first tutorial on `Angular 5`.
Enough for today. Bye Folks.
